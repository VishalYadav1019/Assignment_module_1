#Write a Python program to find the second smallest number in a list

l=[1,23,23,8,3425,1323,124,65]
print(l)
l.sort()#here we can sort the list in the assending order
print(l)

print("the second smallest number in the list is : ",l[1])#after sort then we will print second index number in the list.
